# Express REST API

## Overview

This project is a REST API built using Express.js for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It provides endpoints for managing resources, allowing clients to interact with the data using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The API was tested using Postman, ensuring robust functionality and reliability.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on resources.
- **Express Middleware**: Utilizes Express middleware for handling requests, parsing JSON, and error handling.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a database to store and retrieve data using Sequelize or MongoDB, providing flexibility in database management.
- **Postman Testing**: Tested thoroughly using Postman to ensure API functionality and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Sequelize or MongoDB**: Sequelize for SQL databases or MongoDB for NoSQL databases, providing database integration.
- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for API development used for testing and debugging API endpoints.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) installed and running
